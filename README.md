# üê≤ dragon-server

## THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS PROJECT AND IS NOT YET READY FOR PRODUCTION USE

`dragon-server` is a long-lived web server with a few key features:

- Autodiscovery of labeled docker containers
- Automatic SSL certificate generation and renewal
- Automatic DNS configuration support for
  - Cloudflare,
  - Amazon Route53,
  - DigitalOcean

## Use Case

This server is designed to be long-lived and low maintenance. It is ideal for
containerized projects that do not require scaling consideration. For projects
that do require scaling, container orchestration tools like Kubernetes are
recommended.

## TODO - working example

- [ ] Harden server with [CrowdSec](https://www.crowdsec.net/) (maybe look at [os-caddy](https://docs.opnsense.org/manual/how-tos/caddy.html))
- [ ] Default error pages for static server
- [x] Create first-boot experience to collect domain and email for caddy
- [x] Add caddy configs for automatic dns (comment out by default)
- [ ] [Disable root login](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-disable-root-login-on-ubuntu-20-04)
    - [ ] Ensure we copy the ssh key to the new user on first boot
- [x] Issue with storage config permissions in Caddyfile
- [ ] Look into Podman auto-discovery progress for Caddy
